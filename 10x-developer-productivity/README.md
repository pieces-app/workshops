# 10x Your Developer Productivity with AI-Enabled Tools

This folder contains all the resources for the 10x developer productivity talk and demo.

## Prerequisites

To run this demo, you will need:

- Pieces installed and running locally. You can download it from [pieces.app](https://pieces.app).
- Flutter installed on your machine. You can download it from [flutter.dev](https://flutter.dev).
- This repo cloned, with the `my_amazing_flutter_app` project loaded in an IDE and able to run.
- Start a chat with someone in a collaboration tool and ask them about a spinner to use in your app to show the copilot chat loading. Have them recommend spinkit.

## Train the trainer

There is a train the trainer video available to give a demonstration of this talk, with details on how to set it up.

## Hands on demos

The slides contain instructions for the hands on demos you can run.

### Recorded demos

There are video versions of each demo available with the pages marked as `disabled`:

```markdown
---
transition: fade
layout: center
disabled: true
---

<video controls width="640">
    <source src="/10x-developer-productivity/video/copilot-live-context.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
```

You can enable these by removing the `disabled: true` line. You can then use these videos in place of the live demos. When you navigate to the relevant slide, pressing next slide will play the video.

### Run the demos manually

You can find the app and snippets for the demos in the [`demo`](./demo) folder. This is referenced in the slides.

## Abstract

Here is an abstract if you want to submit this as a CFP. Feel free to re-write this in your own voice:

In today's fast-paced development environment, a developer's attention is constantly in high demand. To achieve peak productivity, developers need to maintain a state of flow, seamlessly accessing the knowledge and tools required to solve complex problems. However, the reality often involves juggling multiple tools, leading to frequent context switching and reduced efficiency.

This session will explore how AI-enabled tools can revolutionize your development workflow, helping you become a 10x developer. We will look into the three primary pillars of development: coding in your IDE, using collaboration tools, and researching in your browser. By integrating AI tools, you can streamline these activities, minimizing context switching and maximizing focus.

Key takeaways from this session include:

- **Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs):** Learn how to use LLMs to research and write code, debug issues, and generate new code snippets.
- **Integrating Copilots into Your Workflow:** Discover how AI copilots embedded in your IDE can assist you in real-time, reducing the need to switch between different tools.
- **Managing Code Snippets:** Understand the importance of a dedicated snippet management tool powered by AI to organize and utilize code snippets effectively.
- **Adding Context to Your Copilot:** Explore how to enhance your copilot's effectiveness by incorporating additional context from local files, folders, and live collaboration tools.
- **Advanced AI Applications:** See demonstrations of AI in action for unit testing, error handling, and code reviews.

Through practical demos and real-world examples, this session will show you how to harness the power of AI to handle the range of context you encounter daily, ultimately boosting your productivity and allowing you to focus on what you do bestâ€”coding.

Join us to discover how AI can be your ultimate productivity partner, transforming the way you develop software and helping you achieve more in less time.
