# What is Pieces?

<img class='bottom-image' width='400' src='/supercharge-student-journey/img/Robot_CTA_Coffee_DM.webp'/>

<!--

Pieces for Developers is an AI-powered tool designed to help developers, from students and hobbyists to professional developers, and even other users streamline their workflow and boost productivity. 

Unlike typical AI coding tools, Pieces is designed to understand the entire context of your workflow. This means you can share code snippets, code files and project folders, and even have it interact with all the apps that are running on your computer.

Let's look at using Pieces in a variety of scenarios:

- How it can assist you in the classroom and lectures
- How you can use it for self guided learning
- Using it for hackathons
- Preparing for exams and interviews

# Demo

Learning binary trees

<img class='bottom-image' width='400' src='/supercharge-student-journey/img/Robot_CTA_Science_DM.webp'/>

<!--

Imagine you are in a data structures and algorithms class, preparing for your leetcode practice.

The lecturer starts talking about binary trees, and you have no idea what one is - maybe you missed a class, maybe the lecturer is assuming you already know.

You need to know what one is, so how about you ask the Pieces copilot!

Open Pieces for Developers and ask in a copilot chat: What is a binary tree?

Its given us a detailed answer, some terminology, a list of types and maybe some code.

Pieces uses an LLM behind the scenes to answer your questions, geared up to focus on developer problems.

You can select from a range of LLMs, both on-line and offline.

<!--

Next the lecturer shares a slide with some code on it which is the base of a binary tree implementation in Python.

The assignment is to add more to this code to delete nodes, and to find nodes.

So you need a copy of this code.

# Demo

Saving code snippets

<img class='bottom-image' width='250' src='/supercharge-student-journey/img/Robot_Save_DM.webp'/>

<!--

Pieces to the rescue once again. If this code is available as text, you can capture a code snippet from your browser, or from dropping the file in.

I am using the browser extension to capture some code, maybe from a gist shared by the lecturer.

Once captured, it is available in Pieces and augmented by AI. I can now use this in my own applications.

The AI adds things like the URL it came from, and any relevant history from my browser in case I want to backtrack, it adds tags, notes, relevant search queries, and a description of the code.

Pieces supports capturing code snippets from your browser or IDE, or from code files.

Demo using the browser extension to grab a code snippet from https://gist.github.com/jimbobbennett/d414fa175390f7dc7524952ae8ddbf9d
Show the augmented code

Sometimes however you don't have the code as code, sometimes all you might have is a screenshot, or even a photo of a slide. Pieces can take your images and convert them to code, then augment with AI.

Demo grabbing a screenshot using the capture tool of your choice (Cmd+4 on macOS, Windows+shift+s on Windows), then dragging that to Pieces desktop.
Show the augmented code

# Demo

Sharing code snippets

<img class='bottom-image' width='250' src='/supercharge-student-journey/img/Robot_Share_DM.webp'/>

<!--

As well as capturing code snippets, Pieces can also share what you captured with your friends or fellow students. Great for tracking things you missed, or discussing code in a study group.

Use Pieces to share a code snippet as a link or a Gist, then open this in your browser.

Here I am creating a sharable link for my snippet, which I can then send to my friends. I can also share as a Gist if I want this public.

When shared, all the metadata is also shared.

# Self-guided learning

<img class='bottom-image' width='300' src='/supercharge-student-journey/img/Robot_Enrich_DM.webp'/>

<!--

You've learned about binary trees, doing some research in class and saving a code snippet which you shared with a friend.

Now you are doing some self-guided learning ready to write a paper on binary trees, either alone or in a study group. How can Pieces help you here?

-->

---
transition: fade
layout: center

# Demo

Ask the copilot to explain some code

<img class='bottom-image' width='500' src='/supercharge-student-journey/img/Robot_creating_content_DM.webp'/>

<!--

The Pieces copilot can explain code, either code you paste into a chat, or a code snippet. What's also great is that your code snippets are wherever you are, in the desktop app, your browser, or in your IDE. This means you can save a code snippet in the browser, augment it in the desktop app, then use it from your IDE, such as in VS Code or a Jetbrains IDE.

Open up Pieces in your IDE.
Go to the binary tree snippet you just captured and start a copilot chat. From here ask the copilot to explain the code line by line.

Walk through the breakdown.

# Demo

Ask the copilot to comment the code

<img class='bottom-image' width='500' src='/supercharge-student-journey/img/Robot_creating_content_DM.webp'/>

<!--

As well as explaining the code, it's also useful to comment your code as well. Pieces has code lenses to help with this.

If you have the code in a file in your project, the code lens can quickly add comments.

Open a file containing the binary tree code - one is provided in the demo folder.

Use the code lens to comment the code. Then annotate with the annotate button that appears in the snippet. Finally delete the original code and insert the new code at cursor.

</SlidevVideo>

<!--

Here I have my binary tree code open in a Python file. I'm going to use the code lens to comment the function.

Now LLMs are not always 100% clear on what you want, and in this case it hasn't added line level comments as well, I guess it sees it as a small function so doesn't need it.
I can use Pieces to annotate the code to get line level comments as well.

Now I'm done, I can insert this code back into my file with all the comments.

-->

# Demo

Ask the copilot to summarize documentation

<img class='bottom-image' width='300' src='/supercharge-student-journey/img/Robot_Extract_DM.webp'/>

<!--

Pieces is able to provide real time context over what you are reading or discussing regardless of the app you use. Pieces watches over your shoulder, capturing context for all the developer activities you do in a secure, private way, all on device. It can then make what it captures available to your copilot chats - sending only whats relevant to the LLM. For more security you can use an on-device LLM to avoid sending anything anywhere.

This is very helpful for summarizing things like documentation, lecture notes, or conversations in chat tools.

In this example, I'm reading a Wikipedia page on binary trees. I can then ask Pieces to summarize what I've just read with the prompt:

Summarize the wikipedia article on binary trees I just read

It summarizes the article. I can then ask for a summary of the operations on the binary tree in the same article using the prompt:

Describe the operations you can run on a binary search tree as describe in the wikipedia article I was just reading

It then summarizes the prompt.

# Hackathons

<img class='bottom-image' width='300' src='/supercharge-student-journey/img/Robots_Launching_rocket_DM.webp'/>

<!--

We all know that the way to kick your code game up a level is to get involved in a hackathon. A short period of time to build something really focuses you on the task at hand. So how can Pieces help you with a hackathon?

-->

---
transition: fade
layout: center

# Demo

Ask the copilot to summarize a folder of code

<img class='bottom-image' width='300' src='/supercharge-student-journey/img/Robot_Jukebox_DM.webp'/>

<!--

As well as asking the copilot questions of code snippets or from the live context of what you are working on, you can also drag in files and folders to ask questions over.

Imagine you have joined a hackathon team, and they have already started building something out that you need to get up to speed with quickly, or you decide to use an existing project or quickstart to build on. Pieces can help.

Start a new copilot chat, and drag in the cubeflyer folder from the demo folder. Then ask the copilot:

Describe this babylonjs project

It will describe the project, so work through the output

# Demo

Translate code

<img class='bottom-image' width='300' src='/supercharge-student-journey/img/Robot_losing_Papers_DM.webp'/>

<!--

The copilot can translate code from one language to another. You can do it for a snippet, or do it in the copilot chat.

This is very helpful if you find a snippet of code to solve a problem in one language, but you are using another.

The game that we are basing out hackathon on is in TypeScript, and we can solve a problem we have using the binary tree we just learned about! The code we have is in Python, so lets translate it to TypeScript.

From Pieces, head to the binary tree snippet and translate the code. Once translated, save as a duplicate and rename.

<SlidevVideo v-click autoplay muted controls width="750">
  <source src="/supercharge-student-journey/video/translate-python-typescript.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</SlidevVideo>

<!--

From the Pieces snippets, I can edit a snippet then translate it to another language. As part of doing this I can provide the copilot some guidance, such as if I wanted to use a particular library or naming convention.

I then convert the snippet, and save it as a duplicate. I can also overwrite the original if I want.

Once saved, I rename the duplicate and it's ready to use in my game.

-->

transition: fade
layout: center

# Demo

Create code

<img class='bottom-image' width='300' src='/supercharge-student-journey/img/Robot_losing_Papers_DM.webp'/>

<!--

The classic use case for copilots is to write code for you. For example, with the game project we have, we can ask the copilot how to save the score to local storage so that it remains between sessions.

From VS code, start a new copilot chat and ask the following:

in a babylonjs game, how can I save the players score to local storage

Show the generated code.

# Demo

Edit code

<img class='bottom-image' width='300' src='/supercharge-student-journey/img/Robot_with_Desktop_DM.webp'/>

<!--

You can use the copilot to edit code that already exists.

Open the cubeflyer game in VS Code.

Open the player.js file. Select the init method, right click, pieces, ask copilot. Ask:

rewrite this code with the player as a sphere instead of a box

Delete the original code and insert the new code at cursor.

# Demo

Get practice problems

<img class='bottom-image' width='500' src='/supercharge-student-journey/img/Robot_in_Lab_DM.webp'/>

<!--

The Pieces copilot can generate practice problems for you to work on, and can give you the answers as well to check your work. Obviously you could use this to cheat - get a problem and as the copilot to solve it, but this won't help you in the long run as you won't be able to solve the problem once you are in an interview.

For example, open Pieces desktop, and ask the copilot:

what is an example leetcode problem that is good to try to solve for a data structures and algorithms interview

Show the output. You can also play around with asking for another problem without a solution, then asking for the solution in the programming language of your choice, then asking it to explain the solution.

# Demo

Explain a concept

<img class='bottom-image' width='400' src='/supercharge-student-journey/img/Robot_with_List_DM.webp'/>

<!--

The last example suggested a hash table, but what is one? We can use Pieces to explain.
