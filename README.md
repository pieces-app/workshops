# Workshops

This repo contains a set of open source talks and workshops to introduce and demo Pieces, as well as concepts such as how AI can help you become a 10x developer.

All the slides for these workshops are built using [Slidev](https://sli.dev/), a Vue.js based presentation framework, allowing you to create slides in markdown.

## Workshop contents

All these workshops are self contained, with a core set of styles and other components. Each workshop slide deck is implemented as a markdown file in the root folder, linking to core content in a folder with the same name.

You can find more details about setting up and running each workshop in the respective folders.

## Run the slides

Each workshop has pre-requisites, defined in the README in the relevant folder. This list what you need, such as a specific development tool, or downloaded LLMs. Make sure you work through these before running the slides.

To run the slides, you need to have Node.js installed. Then do the following:

1. From your terminal, navigate to the workshop folder you want to run.
1. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

1. Start the slides using the command provided in the [workshop list](#workshop-list). Run this from the root folder.
1. Open the slides in your browser at [`http://localhost:3030`](http://localhost:3030).
1. Open the presenter mode in your browser at [`http://localhost:3030/presenter`](http://localhost:3030/presenter).

The presenter mode includes the following:

- Current slide, and a preview of the next slide
- Speaker notes
- Easy navigation controls if you need to jump around between slides
- Annotation tools
- A timer

## Add a new workshop

To add a workshop, do the following:

1. Create a new folder in the root with the name of the workshop.
1. Create a `slides.md` file in the new folder, and add your slide content, as well as any other assets you need.
1. Create a `README.md` file in the new folder, and add details about the workshop, how to run it, and any other information you need.
1. Create a markdown file in the root of this repo named the same as the folder with an `.md` extension.
1. In this new markdown file, copy the contents of one of the other workshop markdown files, and update the location of the `slides.md` file to point to the new folder.

    ```json
    {
        "scripts": {
            "dev10x": "slidev --config 10x-developer-productivity.md",
            "hands-on": "slidev --config supercharge-student-journey.md",
